<h2> Bangladeshi Female Workers</h2>
  <p class="textFormat">Women are the majority of the garment factory workforce. The garment industry pays them cents for their hard labor, which fuels the cycle of poverty, continuing to keep the women and their children in poverty. Women are also subjected to physical, sexual, and verbal abuse in garment factories. They get minimal breaks and their pay is reduced by the time they spend eating and using the bathroom. </p>
<h2> Working Conditions</h2>
    <p class="textFormat"> The factories in which the Bangladeshi women work in are unsanitary and crowded. The piping, walls, and fire alarms are rarely up to date and pass safety guidelines, which allows disasters to occur, like the Dhaka factory fire in 2012. </p>
<h2> The Environment</h2>
    <p class="textFormat">Fast-fashion companies use synthetic fibers which take years to biodegrade (Maiti, 2020). Water leftover from dyes used on clothing ends up in the ocean, along with microplastics that are used to make clothing. </p>
