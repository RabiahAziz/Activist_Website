<h2>Try the #NoNewClothes Challenge</h2>
<p>Try to not buy clothes for 90 days and see if you can implement it into your everyday life. For more information, read up on it <a href="https://remake.world/stories/style/nonewclothes/">here</a>.</p>
<h2> Tell Companies to #PayUp on Social Media</h2>
<p> PayUp is an online hashtag that pressures companies to pay their workers a living wage. Using this method has worked before, and you can check what brands to boycott and call out <a href= "https://payupfashion.com/tracking-brands/">here</a>. </p>
<h2> Wear Your Clothes!</h2>
<p> Before you think that you need to buy new clothes, think- have you worn your old clothes enough? Chances are, you have barely put any wear into your clothes. Clothes are meant to be worn, so wear your clothes, and remember the true cost behind every t-shirt.</p>
<h2> Buy Clothes Second-Hand</h2>
<p> A simple way to give clothing that doesn't fit your style or body anymore is by donating it to thrift stores or doing clothing swaps with friends. Clothing does <strong>not</strong> belong in a trashcan. You can sell clothing online through Poshmark and Depop, or you can donate your clothing to Goodwill and other thrift stores in your location. You can find local thrift stores <a href="https://www.thethriftshopper.com/">here</a>.</p>
<h2> Educate Yourself and Others</h2>
<p>Spread information on clothing brands like Zara and Shein, and on celebrities like Elon Musk, Kylie Jenner, and Jeff Bezos, who do not pay their workers a living wage. For more information on companies that don't pay their workers a living wage, click <a href="https://www.oxfam.org.au/what-we-do/economic-inequality/workers-rights/corporate-accountability/naughty-or-nice-2019/">here</a>.</p>
